🕒 Digital Clock

This project dynamically displays the current time and date, updating every second in real-time.

⚙️ How It Works

JavaScript’s Date() object fetches the system’s current time and date.

The update() function formats the time into hours, minutes, and seconds, adds AM/PM, and shows the current date.

setInterval(update, 1000) refreshes the display every second.
